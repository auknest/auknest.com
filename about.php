    <h3 class="orange">Welcome to Auknest!</h3><br>
    <div class="justify1 blue-font bold">Home, for some it is a just a space with four walls and a roof, while for some, it is a space 
        where they can create lovely memories with their friends and family. Where permanent home gives
        you numerous memories, temporary spaces gift you memorable experiences. Whether it is a permanent
        home or a temporary paying guest home, every space is special and dear to your heart, isn't it?
        Finding a space that you can call your own, can get hectic. Especially, in big cities like Pune,
        where there is a building or two, in every corner. Not only the location, but many other factors
        need to be considered before investing. Altogether, the journey of home buying, as well as home 
        renting, both are a ride, full of ups and downs. But, not when you have the right people with you.
        Not when you have Auknest by your side. </div><br>
